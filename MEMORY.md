## How Gonza is coding lately (signals from recent PRs)
- Strong focus on operationalizing a **recommendations/scoring system** within the **Chronos** domain at AgendaPro (Chronos = nombre clave del equipo; app móvil del marketplace para clientes finales; usan Expo/TS; BFF Node.js/TypeScript; microservicios Rails). Aunque entró muy cargado al BFF, hoy está más en Rails (según necesidad):
  - Works on backend pipelines: **precalculations**, **enrichers**, data syncing jobs.
  - Uses job processing + scheduling patterns (Sidekiq / sidekiq-cron style).
  - Invests in documentation/architecture (big README doc PR) alongside feature work.
  - Also does pragmatic production enablement (feature flag enabling recommendations) including test cleanup.
- Pattern: shipping backend infrastructure + keeping docs/tests aligned; comfortable crossing product/ops boundaries.

## Preferences / working agreement
- Writing style: casual, Chilean-neutral; avoid Argentine tone.
- User explicitly authorized broad investigation and use of connected accounts; still confirm before any external outbound action (sending email/messages/posts) to avoid unintended consequences.
